# Usage

```
~$ npm i -g @darksinge/eslint-config
~$ cd /path/to/some/project
~$ darksinge-eslint-config --init
```

## TODO

1. prettier rules aren't recognized. Either need to figure that out with
   eslint, or also copy `.prettierrc.json` during install.
2. The published version copies `.eslintrc.js` instead of
   `.eslintrc-config.js`, even though it works just fine when running locally.
   Need to figure this out.
